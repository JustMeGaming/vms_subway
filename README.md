# vms_subway
Edit of vms_subway to work with both QB/ESX.
You **MUST** **REMOVE** ```TriggerEvent('codem-blackhudv2:SetForceHide', true)``` and ```TriggerEvent('codem-blackhudv2:SetForceHide', false)``` for this to work unless you are using **Codem BlavckhudV2**.
I am not sure if ESX will work, needs testing as I don't have an ESX server. Please post any bugs in the *issues* section.
